          <div><p>
            i grew up in the great state of connecticut in the great town of avon. in high school, i was an avid participant in math competitions, 
            where i discovered my love for math and all of its relatives. i'm not as involved as i used to be anymore (placed top 200 putnam but that's pretty much it), 
            but i always enjoy the occasional problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            competition math aside, i'm currently a software engineering intern at <a href="https://www.snapsheetclaims.com/" target="_blank">snapsheet</a>, where i revamped
            a rubygem that we use to make yaml storage and querying compatible with rails admin. i'm also a TA for the computer science department: in spring 2023, i was part
            of the cs1420 (machine learning) course staff, and now i'm part of the cs1570 (design and analysis of algorithms) team.
          </p>
          <p>
            if it wasn't obvious by this point, i'm pursuing a double bs.c. in computer science and mathematics, focusing on theory and ml for the former. i have a huge
            love for both, so i'm extremely grateful to brown's open curriculum for letting me explore these subjects to the fullest.
